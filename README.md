# Chapter-1
In this chapter, i learned how the Flutter framework architecture works behind the scenes. i learned that Flutter is a great portable UI framework to build mobile applications for iOS and Android. Flutter also plans on supporting development for desktop, web, and embedded devices. I learned that Flutter applications are built from a single codebase that uses widgets to create the UI and that i can develop with the Dart language. I learned that Flutter uses the Skia 2D rendering engine that works with different types of hardware and software. I also learned that the Dart language is AOT compiled to native code, resulting in fast performance for my applications. I learned that Dart is JIT compiled, making it fast to display code changes with Flutterâ€™s stateful hot reload. You learned that widgets are the building blocks for composing the UI, and each widget is an immutable declaration of the UI. Widgets are the configuration to create elements. Elements are the widgets made concrete, meaning mounted and painted on the screen. I learned that the RenderObject implements the basic layout and paint protocols.
